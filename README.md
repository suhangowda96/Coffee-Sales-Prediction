# Coffee Sales Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict coffee sales using historical data. By developing an accurate predictive model, the goal is to help improve inventory management and inform strategic business decisions. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Local CSV file or Kaggle dataset (adjust if needed)
- **Description**: The dataset contains historical coffee sales data along with relevant features (e.g., date, sales, price, promotions) that can influence sales trends.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and ensured consistency in the data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created additional features such as day of the week and month to capture seasonal patterns.
- **Scaling/Normalization**: Applied scaling techniques to normalize numerical features for model training.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized sales trends over time using line plots.
- Examined relationships between sales and other variables with scatter plots and correlation analysis.
- Identified seasonal patterns and key trends that informed the modeling approach.

## Modeling

- **Algorithm**: Utilized regression models from Scikit-Learn (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor) to forecast coffee sales.
- **Model Tuning**: Performed hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results

- Delivered accurate sales forecasts with a low error margin.
- The modelâ€™s predictions provide actionable insights to optimize inventory management.
